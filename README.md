# encryption
A simple encrypt/decrypt program that utilizes simple encryption algorithm such as XOR, Vigenere and Caesar's.
This program is made as a project for my university subject "Programming Technique II" where we learn OOP. Thank you to Muhammad Haziq, and Muhamad Hadi for being a great group mate, together completing this project.

The files need to be compiled under a project file (.dev) in order for it to work. 
There are several limitations inside the group which you will find once you run it. 
Thank you.
